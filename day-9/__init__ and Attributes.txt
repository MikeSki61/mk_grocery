Day 9: __init__ and Attributes

What Is the __init__ Method?
When you create a new object from a class in Python, the __init__ method is automatically called. This is a special method used to set up the object’s initial state.
Think of it like a startup sequence. If aliens create a clone of a human, the __init__ method is how they program in that clone’s traits—like name, IQ, height, and more.



Revisiting Our Human Class
Here’s a basic example of a class with the __init__ method:

class Human:
    def __init__(self, name, iq):
        self.name = name
        self.iq = iq

    def introduce(self):
        if self.iq < 69:
            print(f"Me {self.name}. Me find rock. Me smash rock. Rock make fire")
        else:
            print(f"Hi, I'm {self.name}, I am a bi-pedal carbon-based lifeform.")


Now let’s create some humans (or clones):
original_human = Human("Bob", 100)
clone_1 = Human("Jeff", 140)
clone_2 = Human("Grog", 28)

original_human.introduce()
clone_1.introduce()
clone_2.introduce()


Each object is created with specific attributes (name and iq) that determine how it behaves.



What Are Attributes?
Attributes are pieces of data that belong to an object. They define what makes one object different from another.
For example:
original_human.name → "Bob"

or
clone_2.iq → 50




Even though all three are “Human” objects, their attributes make them behave differently.



Adding More Attributes
You can customize your class to store more information:
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name, iq, height, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.iq = iq
        self.height = height  # in cm
        self.weight = weight  # in lbs


Now we create more detailed humans:
original_human = Human("Bob", 100, 175, 180)
clone_1 = Human("Jeff", 140, 182, 160)
clone_2 = Human("Grog", 50, 160, 200)


To access attributes individually:
print(clone_1.height)  # 182
print(clone_1.weight)  # 160


To view all attributes at once:
print(clone_1.__dict__)
print(vars(clone_1))

Both will return a dictionary of the object’s attributes.
Using Default Values
You might not always want to enter all the information when creating an object. You can set default values inside your class:
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.iq = 100
        self.height = 173
        self.weight = 175


Now you can just create a human by passing only the name:
clone_1 = Human("Jeff")


You can still update attributes later:
clone_1.height = 183





Adding More Personality
You can continue to expand your class to add even more attributes like:
hair_color


eye_color


clothing


emotion


environment


special_features


Now let’s make a unique character:
clone_3 = Human("Chad")
clone_3.iq = 130
clone_3.height = 198
clone_3.weight = 210
clone_3.hair_color = "blonde"
clone_3.eye_color = "blue"
clone_3.clothing = "high end Kiton business suit"
clone_3.emotion = "cheeky smirk with raised eyebrows"
clone_3.environment = "business finance office"
clone_3.special_feature = "defined jawline"





Bonus: Generating a Prompt From Attributes
You can even write a method to use all of these attributes in a formatted description 
def prompt(self):
    return f"""
    Create a highly detailed portrait of a character named {self.name}, 
    who is {self.height} cm tall and weighs {self.weight} lbs. They have 
    an IQ of {self.iq}, reflecting their intelligence and charisma in their 
    demeanor. {self.name} has {self.hair_color} hair, {self.eye_color} eyes, 
    and wears {self.clothing}. Their expression shows {self.emotion}, and 
    they are in a {self.environment}. Highlight their {self.special_feature}.
    """

print(clone_3.prompt())


You now have a full character profile—custom-built using attributes from your class.

What’s Next?
This module covered the foundation of how objects are structured and how data is stored inside them. Don’t worry if this feels like a lot—these are deep concepts that become clearer with practice.
In the next module, we’ll explore methods—the functions that belong to classes and bring your objects to life.
