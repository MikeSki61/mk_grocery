Day 8: Setting Up Logging

We don’t want our code to be filled with print statements—it looks messy and is hard to manage. Instead, a Logger helps you track what’s happening in your app while keeping the code clean and professional. Let’s set it up

Creating the log_config.py
First, let’s create a new module called log_config.py. This file will set up and configure our logging system.

Import Required Modules
At the top of log_config.py, import the following:
logging for the logging system
os for file and directory handling
constants for the EXPORT_PATH constant

import logging
import os
import constants



 Ensuring the Log Directory Exists
We need to make sure the directory where logs will be stored exists. 
Use os.makedirs with the EXPORT_PATH constant and the exist_ok=True flag to create it if it doesn’t already exist.
# Create the export path if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs(constants.EXPORT_PATH, exist_ok=True)


Setting the Log File Path
Next, define the log_file_name:
Combine EXPORT_PATH with the log file name, like grocery_logger.log.
This is where all your logs will be saved.
# Get the log file name
log_file_name = os.path.join(constants.EXPORT_PATH, 'grocery_logger.log')



Configuring the Logger
Now let’s configure the logger using logging.basicConfig. 
filename: The path to our log file.
level: Set the logging level to DEBUG so we capture all messages—info, warnings, errors, and critical logs.
format: We will use the following format but you can change this to your preference: '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s' 
This includes the timestamp, the level of the log (e.g., DEBUG orERROR), and the actual log message.

Example for sending logs to an external file:
# Setup the log config
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=log_file_name,   # Log output file
    level=logging.DEBUG,          # Log level (DEBUG captures everything)
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',  # Log message format
)




Adding Logging to the Core Module
Head over to the core module and integrate logging into the code.

Import log_config and logging
At the top of your core module, import your new log_config file and the logging module.
import re
import uuid
import os
import logging

import utils
import constants
import log_config


Adding Log Statements
Add log statements to key parts of your code. Logging helps you understand what’s happening in your program, especially when things go wrong. Here are a few examples:
Log when a function starts or finishes.
Ie. started/finished adding an item to the grocery list.
Log the success or failure of a process.
Ie. The grocery list was successfully exported.
Log errors or unexpected behavior.
Ie. Unable to add an item to the list

Adding Stream Handlers (Optional)
Currently our logs are written to a file, but if you prefer to see logs directly in the terminal while developing, you can add a stream handler.
Note that we typically do not want the user to see our logs, so this is something that is done for you the developer when debugging

Stream handlers output logs to the console in real-time.
For this instead of adding a filename, we provide a stream handler with logging.StreamHandler()

StreamHandler Example:
# Setup logging configuration to display logs in the terminal only
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Log level (DEBUG captures everything)
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',  # Log message format
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler()  # StreamHandler outputs to the console
    ]
)




Adding Logs to the Launch Module
Let’s also add logs to the launch module. This will help you track how the user is interacting with your app.
Log messages when:
commands run
inputs are received
errors occur

Logging Checklist
Add logs to key functions in your code
Replace any print statements that are not for users with log statements
Track processes and monitor user actions
Implement different logging levels. Start small with logging.info() then expand with debug, error, and critical.
Test all your functions and see if it provides you enough information to know what is happening in your app from logs.
