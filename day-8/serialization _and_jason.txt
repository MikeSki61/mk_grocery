# Day 8: Serialization & JSON

# What is Serialization?
# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object 
# into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and later reconstructed. 
# In Python and other programming languages, serialization is essential for 
# saving data to files, sending data over a network, or persisting the state of objects for later use.

# Why is Serialization Important for File Handling?
# Serialization is a critical aspect of file handling because it allows:
# Data Storage: You can save complex data structures (like dictionaries, 
# lists, or custom objects) into files in a standardized format.
# Data Sharing: Serialized data can be shared between applications, systems, 
# or programming languages seamlessly.
# Efficiency: Serialized formats are often compact and structured, making them
#  easier to store and retrieve efficiently.
# Cross-Language Compatibility: Formats like JSON enable data sharing between 
# systems written in different programming languages.

# Common Serialization Methods
# JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): Lightweight, human-readable, and widely 
# supported across platforms and languages.
# Pickle: Python-specific binary format for serializing complex Python objects.
# YAML: Human-readable format, often used in configuration files.
# MessagePack: Compact binary format, designed for efficiency.
# XML: Markup language for structured data, but verbose compared to JSON.

# Why JSON is Ideal for Most Cases
# Human-Readable: JSON is easy to read and understand, even for non-developers.
# Language Independence: JSON is supported by almost all programming languages, 
# making it excellent for cross-platform data exchange.
# Web-Friendly: JSON is the default format for web APIs, ensuring smooth 
# integration with web services.
# Lightweight: Compared to XML, JSON has a minimal overhead, making it faster 
# to transmit and parse.

# How to Use JSON in Python
# Import the json Module
# import json

# Serialize (Convert Python Data to JSON)
# Convert to JSON string with json.dumps()
# data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "is_student": True}
# json_string = json.dumps(data)  # Output: '{"name": "Alice", "age": 
# 25, "is_student": true}'

# OR
# Write to a JSON file with :
# with open("data.json", "w") as file:
#     json.dump(data, file)


# Deserialize (Convert JSON to Python Data)
# Convert JSON string to Python data:
# json_string = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "is_student": true}'
# data = json.loads(json_string)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', '
# age': 25, 'is_student': True}

# Read from a JSON file:
# with open("data.json", "r") as file:
#     data = json.load(file)

# Serialization vs. Deserialization:
# Serialization: Converts a Python object (e.g., dict or list) 
# into a JSON format (string or file).
# Example: json.dumps(data) or json.dump(data, file)
# Deserialization: Converts JSON data (string or file) back into a Python object.
# Example: json.loads(json_string) or json.load(file)

# Encoding vs. Decoding:
# Encoding: The process of converting a Python object into a J
# SON-compliant string format (part of serialization).
# Example: json.dumps(data) encodes Python data into a JSON string.
# Decoding: The process of converting a JSON string into a Python 
# object (part of deserialization).
# Example: json.loads(json_string) decodes JSON into Python data.

# Summary
# Serialization/Deserialization: Concerned with converting data to/from
#  JSON format for storage or transmission.
# Encoding/Decoding: Focuses on transforming Python objects into JSON 
# strings (encoding) and vice versa (decoding).
