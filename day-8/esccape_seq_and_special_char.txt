Day 8: Escape Sequences

Escape sequences and special characters are essential components of Python that allow you to represent characters in strings that might otherwise be difficult to include. They enable you to format strings, include non-printable characters, or use symbols like newlines or tabs within a string. These features are particularly important when working with file paths, formatting text, or displaying special symbols.
For example, consider a file path:
file_path = "C:\Users\John\Documents\menu.txt"

Without escape sequences, this path could produce errors because 
the backslash (\) is a special character in Python.

Why They Are Important
Escape sequences ensure that you can represent text accurately and avoid errors
 when handling strings. They help create formatted output, represent paths, and 
 include special characters seamlessly. Understanding escape sequences is 
 critical for writing robust Python programs.
Suppose you’re creating a script to load a recipe file:
# Incorrect usage
file_path = "C:\Users\John\Documents\menu.txt"
print(file_path)
# Output: C:\Users\John\Documents\menu.txt

To avoid incorrect formatting, you use an escape sequence:
# Correct usage
file_path = "C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\menu.txt"
print(file_path)
# Output: C:\Users\John\Documents\menu.txt

Alternatively, using raw strings simplifies this:
# Using raw strings
file_path = r"C:\Users\John\Documents\menu.txt"
print(file_path)
# Output: C:\Users\John\Documents\menu.txt

Common Escape Sequences

\t
Tab
"Item:\tBurger"
\\
Backslash
"Path: C:\\Menu"
\'
Single quote

Double quote
"He said \"Yum\""
\b
Backspace
N/A
\r
Carriage return
N/A
\v
Vertical tab

Raw Strings
Raw strings are strings where escape sequences are treated as plain text.
They are created by prefixing the string with an r or R. Raw strings are 
especially useful for paths and regular expressions.
Example:
# Without raw string
recipe_path = "C:\\Recipes\\Desserts\\cake.txt"
print(recipe_path)

# With raw string
recipe_path = r"C:\Recipes\Desserts\cake.txt"
print(recipe_path)

Practice Exercises
Exercise 1: Format a Menu
Write a string that displays the following text using escape sequences:
Menu:
	1. Pizza
	2. Burger
	3. Salad

print("Menu: \n \t 1.Pizza \n \t 2.Burger \n \t, 3.Salad")

Exercise 2: File Path with Raw Strings
Create a raw string to represent the following file path:
C:\Users\Chef\Documents\Recipes\desserts.txt
print("C:\\Users\\Chef\\Documents\\Recipes\\deserts.txt")


Exercise 3: Quotes in a Recipe
Write a string that includes the following sentence:
The chef said, "It's the best cake ever!"
print("C:\\Users\\Chef\\Documents\\Recipes\\deserts.txt")
